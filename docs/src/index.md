Caesar.jl is a community project to facilate software technology development for localization and mapping from multiple sensor data, and multiple sessions or human / semi-autonomous / autonomous agents.  This software is being developed with broadly [Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution), Robotics, and [Work of the Future](https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/) in mind.  Caesar.jl is an "umbrella package" to combine many other libraries from across the Julia package ecosystem.

# Origins in Fundamental Research

Caesar.jl developed as a spin-out project from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  See related works on [the literature page](https://www.juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/refs/literature/).  Many future directions are in the works -- including fundamental research, implementation quality/performance, and system integration.
