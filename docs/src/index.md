Caesar.jl is a community project to facilate software technology development for localization and mapping from multiple sensor data, and multiple sessions or human / semi-autonomous / autonomous agents.  This software is being developed with broadly [Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution), Robotics, and [Work of the Future](https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/) in mind.  Caesar.jl is an "umbrella package" to combine many other libraries from across the Julia package ecosystem.  

# Commercial Products and Services

[NavAbility.io](http://www.navability.io) builds [products and services](https://www.navability.io/products/) which helps the with administration and support of the Caesar.jl community, please reach out for any additional information (info@navability.io), or using the community links provided below.

Various mapping and localization solutions are possible both for commercial and R&D.  We recommend taking a look at:
- The human-to-machine friendly [NavAbility App](https://app.navability.io/home/) interaction; and
- The machine-to-machine friendly NavAbilitySDKs ([Python](https://github.com/NavAbility/NavAbilitySDK.py), [Julia](https://github.com/NavAbility/NavAbilitySDK.jl), [JS](https://github.com/NavAbility/NavAbilitySDK.js), etc.).  Also see the [SDK.py Docs](https://navability.github.io/NavAbilitySDK.py/).

## NavAbility Zero Install Tutorials

Follow [this page to see the **NavAbility Tutorials**](https://navability.github.io/NavAbilitySDK.py/nvatutorials.html) which are zero install and build around specific application examples.

# Origins and Ongoing Research

Caesar.jl developed as a spin-out project from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  See related works on [the literature page](https://www.juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/refs/literature/).  Many future directions are in the works -- including fundamental research, implementation quality/performance, and system integration.
