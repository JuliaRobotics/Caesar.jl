# Tutorial: Hexagonal 2D SLAM Example (Local Compute)

A simple 2D robot trajectory example is expanded below using techniques developed in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
This example is available as a [single script here](https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/RoME.jl/blob/master/examples/Hexagonal2D_SLAM.jl).

## Creating the Factor Graph with `Pose2`

The first step is to load the required modules, and in our case we will add a few Julia processes to help with the compute later on.  
```julia
# add more julia processes
nprocs() < 4 ? addprocs(4-nprocs()) : nothing

# tell Julia that you want to use these modules/namespaces
using RoME, Distributions
```
After loading the RoME and Distributions modules, we construct a local factor graph object in memory:
```julia
# start with an empty factor graph object
fg = initfg()

# Add the first pose :x0
addNode!(fg, :x0, Pose2)

# Add at a fixed location PriorPose2 to pin :x0 to a starting location
addFactor!(fg, [:x0], PriorPose2(MvNormal(zeros(3), 0.01*eye(3))) )
```
A factor graph object `fg` (of type `::FactorGraph`) has been constructed; the first pose `:x0` has been added; and a prior factor setting the origin at `[0,0,0]` over variable node dimensions `[x,y,Î¸]` in the world frame.
The type `Pose2` is used to indicate what variable is stored in the node.
Caesar.jl allows a little more freedom in how factor and variable nodes can be connected, while still allowing for type-assertion to occur.

**NOTE** Julia uses just-in-time compilation ([unless pre-compiled](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40116045/why-is-julia-taking-a-long-time-on-the-first-call-into-my-module))
 which is slow the first time a function is called but fast from the second call onwards, since the static function is now cached and ready for use.

The next 6 nodes are added with odometry in an counter-clockwise hexagonal manner. Note how variables are denoted with symbols, `:x2 == Symbol("x2")`:
```julia
# Drive around in a hexagon
for i in 0:5
  psym = Symbol("x$i")
  nsym = Symbol("x$(i+1)")
  addNode!(fg, nsym, Pose2)
  pp = Pose2Pose2(MvNormal([10.0;0;pi/3], diagm([0.1;0.1;0.1].^2)))
  addFactor!(fg, [psym;nsym], pp )
end
```

At this point it would be good to see what the factor graph actually looks like:
```julia
writeGraphPdf(fg)
```
You should see the program `evince` open with this visual:

## Performing Inference

Let's run the multimodal-incremental smoothing and mapping (mm-iSAM) solver against this `fg` object:
```julia
# perform inference, and remember first runs are slower owing to Julia's just-in-time compiling
tree = wipeBuildNewTree!(fg)
inferOverTree!(fg, tree)
# batchSolve!(fg) # coming soon
```
This will take a couple of seconds (including first time compiling for all Julia processes).

## Some Visualization Plot

2D plots of the factor graph contents is provided by the `RoMEPlotting` package.
See further [discussion on visualizations and packages here](http://www.juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/arena_visualizations.html).
```julia
## Inter-operating visualization packages for Caesar/RoME/IncrementalInference exist
using RoMEPlotting

# For Juno/Jupyter style use
pl = drawPoses(fg)

# For scripting use-cases you can export the image
Gadfly.draw(Gadfly.PDF("/tmp/test.pdf", 20cm, 10cm),pl)  # or PNG(...)
```

## Adding Landmarks as Point2

Suppose some sensor detected a feature of interest with an associated range and bearing measurement
The new variable and measurement can be included into the factor graph as follows:
```julia
# Add landmarks with Bearing range measurements
addNode!(fg, :l1, Point2, labels=["LANDMARK"])
p2br = Pose2DPoint2DBearingRange(Normal(0,0.1),Normal(20.0,1.0))
addFactor!(fg, [:x0; :l1], p2br)

# Initialize :l1 numerical values but do not rerun solver
ensureAllInitialized!(fg)
```
**NOTE** The default behavior for initialization of variable nodes implies the last variable noded added will not have any numerical values yet, please see [ContinuousScalar Tutorial](http://www.juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/tutorialcontinuousscalar.html) for deeper discussion on automatic initialization (`autoinit`).
A slightly expanded plotting function will draw both poses and landmarks (and currently assumes labels starting with `:x` and `:l` respectively) -- notice the new landmark bottom right:
```julia
drawPosesLandms(fg)
```

## One type of Loop-Closure

Loop-closures are a major part of SLAM based state estimation.
One illustration is to take a second sighting of the same `:l1` landmark from the last pose `:x6`; followed by repeating the inference and re-plotting the result -- notice the tighter confidences over all variables:
```julia
# Add landmarks with Bearing range measurements
p2br2 = Pose2DPoint2DBearingRange(Normal(0,0.1),Normal(20.0,1.0))
addFactor!(fg, [:x6; :l1], p2br2)

# solve
tree = wipeBuildNewTree!(fg)
inferOverTree!(fg, tree)

# redraw
pl = drawPosesLandms(fg)
```

This concludes the Hexagonal 2D SLAM example.

## Interest: The Bayes (Junction) tree

The Bayes (Junction) tree is used as an acyclic (has no loops) computational object, an exact algebraic refactorizating of factor graph, to perform the associated sum-product inference.
The visual structure of the tree can extracted by modifying the command `tree = wipeBuildNewTree!(fg, drawpdf=true)` to produce representations such as this in `bt.pdf`.
