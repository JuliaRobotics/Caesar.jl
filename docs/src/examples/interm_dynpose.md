# Adding Dynamic Factors and Variables

This tutorial describes how a new factor can be developed, beyond the pre-existing implementation in [RoME.jl](http://www.github.com/JuliaRobotics/RoME.jl).  Factors can accept any number of variable dependencies and allow for a wide class of allowable function calls can be used.  Our intention is to make it as easy as possible for users to create their own factor types.

## Example: Adding Velocity to `RoME.Point2`

A smaller example in two dimensions where we wish to estimate the velocity of some target:  Consider two variables `:x0` with a prior as well as a conditional---likelihood for short---to variable `:x1`.  Priors are in the "global" reference frame (how ever you choose to define it), while likelihoods are in the "local" / "relative" frame that only exist between variables.

### Brief on Variable Node `softtypes`

Variable nodes retain meta data (so called "soft types") describing the type of variable.  Common VariableNode types are `RoME.Point2D`, `RoME.Pose3D`.  VariableNode soft types are passed during construction of the factor graph, for example:
```julia
v1 = addVariable!(fg, :x1, Pose2)
```

Certain cases require that more information be retained for each VariableNode, and velocity calculations are a clear example where time stamp data across positions is required.  

**Note** Larger data can also be stored under the bigdata framework which is discussed here (TBD).

If the required VariableNode does not exist, then one can be created, such as adding velocity states with `DynPoint2`:
```julia
mutable struct DynPoint2 <: IncrementalInference.InferenceVariable
  ut::Int64 # microsecond time
  dims::Int
  labels::Vector{String}
  DynPoint2(;ut::Int64=0, labels::Vector{<:AbstractString}=String[]) = new(ut, 4, labels)
end
```
The `dims` field is permanently set to 4, i.e. `[x, y, dx/dt, dy/dt]`.  Labels represent special labels that can be used for more efficient indexing in database systems.  The `ut`parameter is for storing the microsecond time stamp for that variable node.

In order to implement your own factor type outside `IncrementalInference` you should import the required identifiers, as follows:
```julia
using IncrementalInference
import IncrementalInference: getSample
```

**Note** that new factor types can be defined at any time, even after you have started to construct the `FactorGraph` object.

### `DynPoint2VelocityPrior`

Work in progress.

```julia
mutable struct DynPoint2VelocityPrior{T} <: IncrementalInference.FunctorSingleton where {T <: Distribution}
  z::T
  DynPoint2VelocityPrior{T}() where {T <: Distribution} = new{T}()
  DynPoint2VelocityPrior(z1::T) where {T <: Distribution} = new{T}(z1)
end
getSample(dp2v::DynPoint2VelocityPrior, N::Int=1) = (rand(dp2v.z,N), )
```

### `DynPoint2DynPoint2` (preintegration)

The basic idea is that change in position is composed of three components (originating from double integration of Newton's second law):

![deltapositionplus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6412556/40951449-05bdfed8-6845-11e8-8c4f-31fd92523819.gif)
( eq. 1)

 `DynPoint2DynPoint2` factor is using the above equation to define the difference in position between the two `DynPoint2`s.  The position part stored in `DynPoint2DynPoint2` factor corresponds to ![deltaposplusonly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6412556/40951527-70cb4140-6845-11e8-8f06-3e405e4ca54b.gif).  A new multi-variable (so called "pairwise") factor between any number of variables is defined with three elements:
- Factor type definition that inherits either `IncrementalInference.FunctorPairwise` or `IncrementalInference.FunctorPairwiseMinimize`;
```julia
mutable struct DynPoint2DynPoint2{T} <: IncrementalInference.FunctorPairwise where {T <: Distribution}
  z::T
  DynPoint2DynPoint2{T}() where {T <: Distribution} = new{T}()
  DynPoint2DynPoint2(z1::T) where {T <: Distribution} = new{T}(z1)
end
```
- A sampling function with exactly the signature: `getSample(dp2dp2::DynPoint2DynPoint2, N::Int=1)` and returning a `Tuple` (legacy reasons);
```julia
getSample(dp2dp2::DynPoint2DynPoint2, N::Int=1) = (rand(dp2dp2.z,N), )
```
- A residual or minimization function with exactly the signature described below.

Residual (related to `FunctorPairwise`) or factor minimization function (related to `FunctorPairwiseMinimize`) signatures should match this `dp2dp2::DynPoint2DynPoint2` example:
```julia
function (dp2dp2::DynPoint2DynPoint2)(
            res::Array{Float64},
            userdata,
            idx::Int,
            meas::Tuple,
            Xs...  )::Nothing
```
where `Xs` can be expanded to the particular number of variable nodes this factor will be associated, and note they are order sensitive at `addFactor!(fg, ...)` time.  The `res` parameter is a vector of the same dimension defined by the largest of the `Xs` terms.  The `userdata` value contains the small metadata / userdata portions of information that was introduced to the factor graph at construction time -- please consult `error(string(fieldnames(userdata)))` for details at this time.  This is a relatively new feature in the code and likely to be improved.  The `idx` parameter represents a legacy index into the measurement `meas[1]` and variables `Xs` to select the desired marginal sample value.  Future versions of the code plan to remove the `idx` parameter entirely.  The `Xs` array of parameter are each of type `::Array{Float64,2}` and contain the estimated samples from each of the current best marginal belief estimates of the factor graph variable node.  
```julia
function (dp2dp2::DynPoint2DynPoint2)(
            res::Array{Float64},
            userdata,
            idx::Int,
            meas::Tuple,
            Xi::Array{Float64,2},
            Xj::Array{Float64,2}  )
  #
  z = meas[1][:,idx]
  xi, xj = Xi[:,idx], Xj[:,idx]
  dt = (userdata.variableuserdata[2].ut - userdata.variableuserdata[1].ut)*1e-6   # roughly the intended use of userdata
  res[1:2] = z[1:2] - (xj[1:2] - (xi[1:2]+dt*xi[3:4]))
  res[3:4] = z[3:4] - (xj[3:4] - xi[3:4])
  nothing
end
```

A brief usage example looks as follows, and further questions about how the preintegration strategy was implemented can be traced through the original issue JuliaRobotics/RoME.jl#60 or the literature associated with this project, or contact for more information.
```julia
using RoME, Distributions
fg = initfg()
v0 = addVariable!(fg, :x0, DynPoint2(ut=0))

# Prior factor as boundary condition
pp0 = DynPoint2VelocityPrior(MvNormal([zeros(2);10*ones(2)], 0.1*eye(4)))
f0 = addFactor!(fg, [:x0;], pp0)

# conditional likelihood between Dynamic Point2
v1 = addVariable!(fg, :x1, DynPoint2(ut=1000_000)) # time in microseconds
dp2dp2 = DynPoint2DynPoint2(MvNormal([10*ones(2);zeros(2)], 0.1*eye(4)))
f1 = addFactor!(fg, [:x0;:x1], dp2dp2)

ensureAllInitialized!(fg)
tree = wipeBuildNewTree!(fg)
inferOverTree!(fg, tree)

using KernelDensityEstimate
@show x0 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x0))
# julia> ... = [-0.19441, 0.0187019, 10.0082, 10.0901]
@show x1 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x1))
 # julia> ... = [19.9072, 19.9765, 10.0418, 10.0797]
```

### `VelPoint2VelPoint2` (back-differentiation)

In case the preintegrated approach is not the first choice, we include `VelPoint2VelPoint2 <: IncrementalInference.FunctorPairwiseMinimize` as a second likelihood factor example which may seem more intuitive:
```julia
mutable struct VelPoint2VelPoint2{T} <: IncrementalInference.FunctorPairwiseMinimize where {T <: Distribution}
  z::T
  VelPoint2VelPoint2{T}() where {T <: Distribution} = new{T}()
  VelPoint2VelPoint2(z1::T) where {T <: Distribution} = new{T}(z1)
end
getSample(vp2vp2::VelPoint2VelPoint2, N::Int=1) = (rand(vp2vp2.z,N), )
function (vp2vp2::VelPoint2VelPoint2)(
                res::Array{Float64},
                userdata,
                idx::Int,
                meas::Tuple,
                Xi::Array{Float64,2},
                Xj::Array{Float64,2}  )
  #
  z = meas[1][:,idx]
  xi, xj = Xi[:,idx], Xj[:,idx]
  dt = (userdata.variableuserdata[2].ut - userdata.variableuserdata[1].ut)*1e-6   # roughly the intended use of userdata
  dp = (xj[1:2]-xi[1:2])
  dv = (xj[3:4]-xi[3:4])
  res[1] = 0.0
  res[1] += sum((z[1:2] - dp).^2)
  res[1] += sum((z[3:4] - dv).^2)
  res[1] += sum((dp/dt - xi[3:4]).^2)  # (dp/dt - 0.5*(xj[3:4]+xi[3:4])) # midpoint integration
  res[1]
end
```

A similar usage example here shows:
```julia
fg = initfg()

# add three point locations
v0 = addVariable!(fg, :x0, DynPoint2(ut=0))
v1 = addVariable!(fg, :x1, DynPoint2(ut=1000_000))
v2 = addVariable!(fg, :x2, DynPoint2(ut=2000_000))

# Prior factor as boundary condition
pp0 = DynPoint2VelocityPrior(MvNormal([zeros(2);10*ones(2)], 0.1*eye(4)))
f0 = addFactor!(fg, [:x0;], pp0)

# conditional likelihood between Dynamic Point2
dp2dp2 = VelPoint2VelPoint2(MvNormal([10*ones(2);zeros(2)], 0.1*eye(4)))
f1 = addFactor!(fg, [:x0;:x1], dp2dp2)

# conditional likelihood between Dynamic Point2
dp2dp2 = VelPoint2VelPoint2(MvNormal([10*ones(2);zeros(2)], 0.1*eye(4)))
f2 = addFactor!(fg, [:x1;:x2], dp2dp2)

# Graphs.plot(fg.g)
ensureAllInitialized!(fg)
tree = wipeBuildNewTree!(fg)
inferOverTree!(fg, tree)

# see the output
@show x0 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x0))
@show x1 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x1))
@show x2 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x2))
```

Producing output:
```
x0 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x0)) = [0.101503, -0.0273216, 9.86718, 9.91146]
x1 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x1)) = [10.0087, 9.95139, 10.0622, 10.0195]
x2 = getKDEMax(getVertKDE(fg, :x2)) = [19.9381, 19.9791, 10.0056, 9.92442]
```

# IncrementalInference.jl Defining Factors (Future API)

We would like to remove the `idx` indexing from the residual function calls, since that is an unnecessary burden on the user.  Instead, the package will use `views` and `SubArray` types to simplify the interface.  Please contact author for more details (8 June 2018).
