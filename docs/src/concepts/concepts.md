# Caesar Concepts

A factor graph is a bipartite representation where variables (denoted by larger nodes) are interconnected by a set of factors (smaller nodes) that represent some algebraic interaction between the variables.  Factors must adhere to the limits of probabilistic models -- for example conditional likelihoods (between multiple variables) or priors (unary to one variable).  A more heterogeneous factor graph example is shown below, and a broader discussion [here (author disclosure)](https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/handle/1912/9305/Fourie_thesis.pdf?sequence=1):

Discuss factor graphs, variables, factors, accessing data etc.

Discuss plotting (Arena, RoMEPlotting).

Discuss connectivity (database, ZMQ).
