# Creating New Variables and Factors

Discuss design considerations for creating variables and factors.

A couple of important points:
* You do not need to fork and edit Caesar source code
* As long as the factors exist in the working space of the solver, the factors are implicitly used
* Caesar is designed to allow you to add new variables and factors to your own independent repository and incorporate them at will

## A Template Repository

You can fork the following template repository to construct your own [Caesar Template Repository](https://github.com/GearsAD/Caesar_NewFactorTemplate.jl.git).
