$TYPEDEF

This is but one incarnation for how radar alignment factor could work, treat it as a starting point.

Notes
- Stanard `cvt` argument is lambda function to convert incoming images to user convention of image axes,
  - default `cvt` flips image rows so that Pose2 xy-axes corresponds to img[x,y] -- i.e. rows down and across from top left corner.
- Use rescale to resize the incoming images for lower resolution (faster) correlations
- Both images passed to the construct must have the same type some matrix of type `T`.

Example
-------
```julia
arp2 = ScanMatcherPose2(img1, img2, 2) # e.g. 2 meters/pixel 
```
