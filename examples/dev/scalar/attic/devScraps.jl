#     # ...

# 2. This is the actual scalar measurement sequence factor
# It takes two arguments: 
#  - the elevation measurement sequence, and 
#  - the odometry estimate at each elevation measurement
#
# addFactor!(fg, [:x1, :topography], ScalarFieldSequenceFactorNorthSouth(x,y))

# This is used within the factor to generate the likelihood over the terrain
